        <p id="apple">Advantages of Online Grocery Shopping</p> 
        <p id="mango">When it comes to grocery shopping, we fall into two camps: One group loves to go grocery shopping and the other wants to get in and out as fast as possible.</p>
        <p id="orange">Grocery shopping can be time-consuming:</p>

        <p id="banana">-making a list</p>
        <p id="lok">-traveling to and from the store</p>
        <p id="jsad">-browsing through seemingly endless aisles to find what you’re looking for</p>
   
        <p id="a">Online grocery shopping is a dream come true for today’s generation. Specially, for all those women/men who always wanted to do</p>
        <p id="ab">grocery shopping on a budget. The landscape of grocery fulfillment has changed greatly, and there are certain advantages and</p>
        <p id="abc">disadvantages to online grocery shopping.</p>

        <p id="b">Before looking into the various companies trying to sell us their services we should look at the advantages and disadv</p>
        <p id="bc">shopping online and the things we should look out for when choosing what website to purchase groceries from.</p>

        <p id="c">It saves time</p>

        <p id="d">Shopping online alleviates the need to walk up and down store aisles. And you can log in any time—even at 2 am—and still have the</p>
        <p id="de">advantage of a fully stocked store. Plus, going the delivery route saves you a trip to the store, which not only saves time, but gas money</p>
        <p id="def">as well. In fact, studies show grocery delivery services slash carbon dioxide emissions in half compared to individual household trips.</p>
        
        <p id="e">No Unwanted Luxury Purchases</p>
        
        <p id="f">It’s far too easy to do; you’re walking around the shop grabbing all the items you need and suddenly a chocolate cake, packet of biscuits,</p>
        <p id="fg">and some sausage rolls have somehow found their way into your trolley. You didn’t want them before but now you’ve seen them you</p>
        <p id="fgh">need them! Shopping online can help you tame the impulse buying within you.</p>
            
        <p id="fghi">Comparisons</p>

        <p id="i">Many online stores have an invaluable feature that will make the lives of countless housewives a hundred times simpler – the feature of</p>
        <p id="ij">price comparison. Online shopping does not compel you to remember how much more expensive eggs are in store A versus store B.</p>
        
        <p id="j">Find Everything You Need</p>
        <p id="jk">Search engines on websites make it much easier to find items quickly; typing in the name or brand of a product will show you all relevant</p>
        <p id="jkl">products making it much easier to find exactly what you need.</p>
